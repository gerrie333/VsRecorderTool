Tool for viewing battle video data from an appropriate source (save file or extracted battle video)
Works with the generation 4 and 5 pokemon games (PtHGSS, BWB2W2)

Planned features
-ability to view the pre-video information (video number, uploader name/sprite/fav pokemon)
-ability to import battle videos back into the save file
-support for the files created by the older platinum video extractor and gen 5 battle video manager
-text readout of the battle video


Special thanks to NulMyre, Kaphotics and the various other battle video researchers for laying the groundwork
